# MusicListenList
Native App Studio - App 6

[![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/emmahokken/MusicListenList?branch=master)](https://bettercodehub.com/)

App allows users to log in using Firebase. 
Users can then search for music using the iTunes API [1].
Many thanks to raywenderlich.com for their clear tutorial on Firebase!

NOTE: I had to downgrade Firebase to version 3.15 because of some major bugs.
